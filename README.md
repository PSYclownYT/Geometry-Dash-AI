# Geometry Dash AI

A Python script for automating jumps in Geometry Dash by detecting specific colors on the screen. The AI monitors designated regions for colors (like red, blue, or green), and automatically performs jumps in response, enabling real-time obstacle avoidance.

## Overview
This script is designed for players looking to automate Geometry Dash gameplay by making the character jump when obstacles are detected. By monitoring specific screen regions, the script identifies obstacle colors and performs jumps based on pre-defined intervals, reacting quickly and consistently to in-game changes.

## Features
- **Real-time color detection**: Scans for obstacles by detecting specific colors within defined screen regions.
- **Automatic jumping**: Performs jumps based on color detections, reacting within milliseconds.
- **Configurable detection regions**: Adjust the detection regions and colors to suit different levels and scenarios in Geometry Dash.
- **Efficient screen capturing**: Utilizes fast screen capture for minimal delay and optimal performance.
  
## Requirements
- **Python** 3.8 or later
- **Pillow** (Python Imaging Library)
- **NumPy** for efficient array handling
- **OpenCV** for screen visualization (optional if visualization is enabled)
- **PyAutoGUI** for automating key presses
- **mss** for high-performance screen capture

Install dependencies via:
```bash
pip install pillow numpy opencv-python pyautogui mss
```

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/geometry-dash-ai.git
   cd geometry-dash-ai
   ```
2. Install the required Python packages listed above.

## Usage
Run the script with:
```bash
python geometry_dash_ai.py
```

### Script Parameters
- **`region_red`** and **`region_green`**: Define the screen regions to monitor for each color.
- **`jump_interval`**: Minimum time (in seconds) between jumps, controlling the rate of jumps.
- **`duration`**: Total runtime duration for the script.

### Example
In `geometry_dash_ai.py`, set up the monitoring regions:
```python
region_red = (left, top, right, bottom)
region_green = (left - 50, top, right - 50, bottom)
```

Configure your jump interval and duration:
```python
detect_color_and_jump(region_red, region_green, jump_interval=0.05, duration=600)
```

## Configuration
### Regions
Define regions based on your screen dimensions and the area where obstacles appear:
- **Red/Blue Detection Region**: Centered in front of the player character.
- **Green Detection Region**: Offset to the left of the player character.

### Colors
You can adjust the colors in the script to detect other obstacles:
- **Red**: `(255, 0, 0)`
- **Green**: `(0, 255, 0)`
- **Blue**: `(0, 0, 255)`

### Optimizations
For best performance:
1. Use smaller regions to minimize processing.
2. Set `jump_interval` based on in-game speed to ensure responsive jumps.

## Notes
- **No Overlay Required**: The script runs without a graphical overlay for better speed.
- **Detection Lag**: Optimizations are implemented, but detection delay may vary depending on screen size and processing power.
